# rosbridge-python-websocket-example
A set of bare-bones examples mini-drivers to control a mobile robot using rosbridge over websockets.

This sample code is meant to demonstrate basic communication without using any special client library, although more sophisticated functionality can be achieved by means of thin client libraries like [roslibjs](http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs) and [roslibpy](https://github.com/gramaziokohler/roslibpy).

For Python example, see python folder.
for Javascript example, see js folder.

Rosbridge enables virtually any device to interact with a ROS system.
The Rosbridge protocol specification is available [here](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/blob/master/ROSBRIDGE_PROTOCOL.md).
